### 1. The Team

[8 points]

a) Who's on the team? (Include names and UNIs)

> Myles Ingram (`mai2125`) and Colin Payne-Rogers (`cmp2250`)

b) How do you plan to divide up the work? (Grading is on a group basis. The point of asking is to encourage you to think about this and design a plan.)

> Myles will focus on data collecting and transformation. Colin will focus on managing the GitHub repository setup. With only two of us, we think we can manage collaborating more closely on plot creation and chapter writing.


c) What is your plan for managing the git/GitHub workflow? That is, who will merge pull requests? How will you attempt to avoid conflicts? How will you communicate?

> With just two of us, we plan to merge each other's pull requests. The team member who writes a given contribution is responsible for resolving merge conflicts. The other team member will serve as reviewer, approve pull requests, and merge them.

### 2. The Questions

[10 points]

List three questions that you hope you will be able to answer from your research. (It's ok if these change as your work progresses.)

a) 
  
  
b) 
  
  
c) 
  

### 3. GitHub repo

[8 points]

a) Set up your final project repository following the EDAVproject template. Provide the link to the repo.

> [https://github.com/cpaynerogers/edav-final]

b) Make sure that all team members have write access to the repository and have practiced making contributions. Provide a link to the contributors page of your repository showing that all team members have made contributions to the repo (Note that we do not have the ability to see who has write access, only contributors):
