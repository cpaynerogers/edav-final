These figures show the trends of digestive system cancer incidence and mortality over the years. As we see here, both the digestive system incidence and mortality rates have been decreasing since 2000, with mortality sharply decreasing after 2014/2015. These graphs also show that men are at a greater risk of developing digestive cancer compared to women and the trends of incidence and mortality for both genders have similar shapes. Now that we have established the trends of digestive system cancer, let's explore dietary trends from 2000 to 2017

## Dietary Trends

### Food Group and Overall Calorie Consumption Trends 

```{r}
# sums all the columns except for the fats and oils column to get the total amount of calories consumed besides the fats and oils
total_cals$`Total (excluding Fats and Oils)` <- rowSums(total_cals[,c(2:6, 8)])

# creates two separate dfs: one for the food groups (tidy_total) and one for the totals (tidy_all)
tidy_total = tidy_calorie_data(total_cals[-c(9,10)])
tidy_all = tidy_calorie_data(total_cals[c(1,9:10)])

cbPalette <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
# graph of the per capita total calorie intake and total calorie intake excluding fats and oils
ggplot(data=tidy_all) +
  geom_line(aes(x=Year, y=calories, color=food_group)) +
  geom_point(aes(x=Year, y=calories, color=food_group, shape=food_group))+
  labs(color = "Calorie Totals", shape = "Calorie Totals")+
  ggtitle("Total Daily Per Capita Calorie Intake from 2000-2017")

# graph of the per capita calorie intake by major food groups
ggplot(data=tidy_total) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=cbPalette)+
  geom_line(aes(x=Year, y=calories, color=food_group)) +
  geom_point(aes(x=Year, y=calories, color=food_group, shape=food_group))+
  ylab("Daily Per Capita Calories")+
  labs(color = "Food Groups", shape = "Food Groups")+
  ggtitle("Daily Per Capita Calorie Intake by Major Food Group from 2000-2017")

```
These graphs show the trend of both the per capita total daily calorie intake and the calorie intake divided by major food groups. The most notable changes for the food groups were sugar and sweeteners, flour and cereal products, and meat, eggs, and nuts. Both sugar and sweeteners and flour and ceral products decreased from 2000 to 2017 while meat, eggs, and nuts increased from 2014-2017 after gradually decreasing before. Intake of fruits and vegetables has also slightly decreased over the years. In terms of calories, both total calories and total calories, excluding fats and oils have been decreasing from 2000-2017 as a whole. However, from 2011 to 2017 total calories excluding fats and oils has risen slightly. Calorie intake data for fats and oils from 2010 onward could not be found leading to the creation of the total calorie intake excluding fats and oils variable. Now that we know that calorie intake has been decreasing as a whole and within many major food groups, let's look at certain foods within each food group to discover more trends.

### Select Food Trends

```
In order to determine how diet is associated with digestive cancer incidence and mortality, we took the top 25 foods that contributed the most to daily caloric intake and analyzed their changes from 2000 to 2017. These food sources included several food sources that are related to digestive cancer such as beef and high fructose corn syrup. Other foods that surprising cracked the top 25 were bananas, cane/beet sugar, and  frozen potatoes. The highest caloric contributer was white and whole flour by a large margin. As shown in the line graph, these food groups changed dynamically from 2000 to 2017 as a whole with foods such as peanuts, chicken, and butter increasing and other foods such as beef, high fructose corn syrup, and ice cream decreasing. Now that we've set the stage, let's jump into the comparisons between cancer incidence/mortality and foods/total calorie intake.


## Comparison of Food/Caloric Intake and Digestive Cancer Trends

### Cancer Incidence
```{r}
# uses the combined sex since male and female cancer have the same trend
sub_inc <- subset(incidence, Sex == "Male")

# used to combine the incidence and major food group/total calories dataframes then tidy
total_cals_inc = merge(total_cals, sub_inc, by="Year")
canc_cals_tidy <- gather(total_cals_inc, food_group, calories, colnames(total_cals_inc)[!colnames(total_cals_inc) %in% c("Year", "Sex", "Population", "Cases")], -c(Year, Rate))
canc_cals_tidy <- canc_cals_tidy[complete.cases(canc_cals_tidy),]

# Splits the dataframe into the major food groups and the totals
canc_food_tidy <- subset(canc_cals_tidy, !food_group %in% c("Total", "Total (excluding Fats and Oils)"))
canc_total_tidy <- subset(canc_cals_tidy, food_group %in% c("Total", "Total (excluding Fats and Oils)"))

# Graph between the calories
ggplot(canc_food_tidy, aes(calories, Rate))+
    geom_point()+
    geom_smooth(method=lm, color="blue", fill="blue")+
    ylab("Rate (per 100,000 people)")+
    xlab("Daily Per Capita Calorie Intake")+
    ggtitle("Cancer Incidence vs Calorie Intake per Major Food Group")+
    facet_wrap(~food_group)
```
Even with using a smoother to draw a line through thte data, the correlations are somewhat unclear using the raw caloric intake values. We can clearly see that both sugar and sweeteners and flour and cereal products correlate with digestive cancer incidence but the trends of the other groups is unclear. We will use percent difference from 2000 per capita caloric intake from now on to show the trends more clearly.

```{r}
# Gets the percent difference from 2000
canc_cals_tidy <- canc_cals_tidy %>% dplyr::group_by(food_group) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(perc_dif = round((calories-first(calories))/first(calories)*100, 4)) 

# Creates a dataframe that has the correlation coefficient between the food group/total and cancer incidence and p_value for correlation
canc_cal_cor <- canc_cals_tidy %>% dplyr::group_by(food_group) %>% dplyr::summarise(Correlation = round(cor(perc_dif, Rate), 2))
temp1 <- canc_cals_tidy %>% dplyr::group_by(food_group) %>% dplyr::summarise(p_value = round(cor.test(perc_dif, Rate)$p.value, 4))
canc_cal_cor$p_value <- temp1$p_value

total_foods_inc = merge(topnafoods_tidy, distinct(canc_cals_tidy[c("Year", "Rate")]), by="Year")


food_inc_cor <- total_foods_inc %>% dplyr::group_by(food_group) %>% dplyr::summarise(Correlation = round(cor(perc_dif, Rate), 2))

```
We found that the decrease in total calorie intake correlated with the decrease in digestive cancer incidence. We also found that food groups such as sweeteners and sugars and cereal/flour products positively correlated with digestive cancer incidence. Surprisingly, we found that fruits caloric intake and vegetable caloric intake correlated positively with digestive cancer incidence. We think that since total caloric intake is associated with cancer incidence, the other food groups appeared to be correlated as well. For the top 25 foods however, we had some more interesting results. As expected, we found that high fructose corn syrup and beef were positively associated with digestive cancer incidence. We also saw ice cream, potatoes, and orange juice trending positively with incidence. On the other hand, we found that butter, peanuts, cane/beet sugar, and mozzarella trended negatively with cancer incidence, meaning the higher the calorie intake of these foods, the lower the incidence.

combined_foods <- foods_inc + foods_mort
combined_foods + plot_layout(guides = "collect") + plot_annotation("Incidence Top Food Correlations vs Mortality Top Food Correlations")
```
Through this graph we can see that the same foods that were correlated with the increase/decrease in cancer incidence were also associated with the increase/decrease of cancer mortality, albiet to slightly different degrees.
