# Conclusion

In conclusion, we found very interesting and satisfactory answers to our initial questions. We observed that digestive cancer incidence and mortality are both decreasing with mortality increasing rapidly in the past couple of years. This may be due to the advances in [digestive system cancer treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4974579/) such as more frequent colonoscopies, monitoring of gut bacteria levels, and novel chemotherapy treatments. All of these advancements have happened in the last couple of decades and have done well to reduce the number of deaths and cases for digestive system cancer.

We also saw that overall caloric intake is associated with digestive cancer, both of which have been decreasing as a whole from 2000. In terms of major food groups, we found that all of them except for proteins and fats correlated with increased digestive cancer rates. However, we can most likely chalk this finding up to all the food groups also correlated with total caloric intake as well. 

In terms of specific foods, there were several expected and unexpected correlations that we uncovered when looking at specific foods. Beef, milk, ice cream, and high fructose corn syrup were all well-documented culprits for digestive cancer but foods like head lettuce, potatoes, and orange juice were unlikely correlates of cancer incidence/mortality. [High fiber foods](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1851150/#:~:text=Abstract,%2C%20endometrial%2C%20and%20gastrointestinal%20cancer.) like avocados, hominy, peanuts, and sweet potatoes trended upwards as digestive cancer trended downards. These types of foods are known to promote gut health and are thought to be protective against several forms of cancer. However, we also found that butter and mozzerella were also negatively associated, despite our pre-existing thoughts about dairy products.

However, these findings are merely correlations. Other factors could contribute to why these specifc foods and food groups rose/decreased over the years. Possibly people who are health conscious have a passion for peanuts. Or interest in canned peaches coincidently waned over the years while digestive cancer rates decreased. Future studies will need to be done in order to vouch for the validity of the claims made here.

In a future study, we could also explore other known correlates of digestive cancer such as alcohol use and smoking habits over the same time period to give more incite into what caused this decrease in digestive cancer incidence and mortality. Another study that could be done is looking at a more granular version of the calorie intake data and cancer incidence/mortality data, such as on a state or county level.
