The data presented in the previous chapter has a few features that aren't conducive to analysis. They're described here, and then in each section an output table is shown to provide a sense of what we're working with. As a light data transformation process, this chapter converts each raw file, regardless of format, into tidy `.csv` files. The raw data is preserved so that no data is lost.

All three data sets, both SEER `.csv` files and the USDA `.xls` file, mix summary statistics with raw data. This is probably great for casual users, but here in EDAV we're well-equipped to choose how, when, and which statistics we produce from well-formed data. In each section below, those rows or columns in each table are removed. This process, and the messiness of the headers in the raw data files, forced us to manually name each data column.

There is a mismatch between the length of the time series data between the SEER and USDA data sets. Helpfully, each data set consists of data points by year (representing population-level statistics for that year). The USDA data set is much older; it consists of data from 1970 to 2017. The younger SEER data set consists of data from 2000 to 2017. The extra food data is kept, in case its interesting, but we'll need to watch out for that in our analysis.

The food data is trapped in an Excel spreadsheet (*help! help!*). This data transformation process liberates it and provides it with all of the freedoms afforded to the comma-separated-value format. Doing so first meant completely bypassing the shackles of the three-to-six-rows-deep header data and carefully naming each column. Each sheet had to be addressed separately.

## Digestive Cancer Data

For both the digestive cancer incidence and mortality, data is loaded, summary rows (by year and by sex) are removed, and the columns are renamed.

### Incidence

```{r}
incidence <- read.csv(
  file='resources/raw_data/digestive_cancer_incidence.csv',
  header=FALSE,
  stringsAsFactors=TRUE)
names(incidence) = c("Year", "Sex", "Rate", "Cases", "Population")
incidence <- incidence[!(incidence$Year == "2000-2017"),]
incidence <- incidence[!(incidence$Sex == "Male and female"),]
rownames(incidence) <- NULL
```

```{r}
kableExtra::scroll_box(
  knitr::kable(head(incidence, N_TABLE), "html"),
  height=TABLE_PIXELS,
  width="100%")
```

### Mortality

```{r}
mortality <- read.csv(
  file='resources/raw_data/digestive_system_cancer_mortality.csv',
  header=FALSE,
  stringsAsFactors=TRUE)
names(mortality) = c("Year", "Sex", "Rate", "Cases", "Population")
mortality <- mortality[!(mortality$Year == "2000-2017"),]
mortality <- mortality[!(mortality$Sex == "Male and female"),]
rownames(mortality) <- NULL
```

```{r}
kableExtra::scroll_box(
  knitr::kable(head(mortality, N_TABLE), "html"),
  height=TABLE_PIXELS,
  width="100%")
```

## Food Consumption

The `tidyverse` `readxl` package is used to parse the `.xls` data. First, we have to get the names of each sheet we have available for processing.

```{r}
calories <- "resources/raw_data/calories.xls"
calories_sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets(calories)
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(paste(calories_sheets, collapse=", "), "simple")
```

Then, in each of the following sections we had to hand-jam in unique column names, since the spreadsheets used merged cells in their headers which are difficult to parse. Then, any column name that contains `Total` is removed, since these make the data messy, and since we'd prefer to make our own summary statistics.

### Meat, Eggs and Nuts

```{r}
meateggsnuts <- readxl::read_excel(
  calories,
  sheet = calories_sheets[4],

## Write Out Data

Hidden code way down here is used to update the data files in `food-digestive-cancer/processed_data/*`. When the bookdown book is rendered locally, this data transform process runs and updates the processed data if necessary. In our case, we're working with relatively small data, so transforming it each time is fine. With heavier data lifts, we'd want a flag to only run the process if its been updated.

```{r}
write.csv(incidence, file='resources/processed_data/incidence.csv')
write.csv(mortality, file='resources/processed_data/mortality.csv')
write.csv(meateggsnuts, file='resources/processed_data/meateggsnuts.csv')
write.csv(dairy, file='resources/processed_data/dairy.csv')
write.csv(fruits, file='resources/processed_data/fruits.csv')
write.csv(vegetables, file='resources/processed_data/vegetables.csv')
write.csv(grains, file='resources/processed_data/grains.csv')
write.csv(fats, file='resources/processed_data/fats.csv')
write.csv(sugars, file='resources/processed_data/sugars.csv')
```
